# The Goal
* For the contributing, please pick a topic, open an issue or reach out on twitter [@chiragbhatia94](https://twitter.com/chiragbhatia94) to get the go-ahead and start contributing.

## Contributing

* [Code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

**No PR will be discarded without explanations!**

## Guidelines
* **Do not add things you have not evaluated personally!**
  Use your critical thinking to filter out non-essential stuff. Give honest arguments for why the request should be included.
* **One item per Pull Request**
  There may be a discussion related to an item you want to add. Adding just a single item per pull request makes it much easier for everyone involved.
* Write meaningful commit messages using [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).
* Look at the existing issues/pull requests before opening new ones
