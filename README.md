# Job Portal POC

A job portal POC in spring & react

# Problem Statement
  - Build a web portal to collect job requests, provision supply candidate information from 
    different sources and provision to update the status against each request and get holistic
    view of requests progress. Possibly, bring out any analytics in dashboard like demand
    fulfillment ratio, supply ratio. Make your own assumptions on different users, required
    simple inputs, workflows and capabilities.

  - Technologies &amp; Assumptions
    - Use GitHub for the code commits and share the link
    - React for UI, Redux Store, etc.,
    - Kotlin/Java + Spring Boot + Unit Testing Frameworks for Backend
    - Possibly deploy on any cloud space for trial run
    - Put guide doc or readme file
    - Don’t need to have a database for capturing inputs, possibility of JSON file as database
    - Have simple inputs, do not go in to very detailed inputs.

  - Recommended Outputs:
    - Identify Test cases in a excel sheet
    - Write Test cases and Test suite for the functionalities you develop.
    - Flow diagram or High-Level architecture view currently you built and how can it be taken
      to next levels
    - Working prototype
